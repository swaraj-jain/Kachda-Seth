# ToysRsus
Our app is basically an interactive way for youngsters to learn about the types of wastes and how to classify them. The user is allowed to capture the image of any waste item and the app will be able to identify its type (biodegradable/non-biodegradable) with a high accuracy. Learning is made fun by making the users guess the waste type by looking at any waste image, and accordingly awarding them points. 
We used a deep learning model to get the predictions, i.e. classify wastes into 34 categories. These categories can then be classified into degradable and non-degradable. The user privacy is maintained as the photo captured is only stored temporarily.
Our app is unique in the way that it gamifies the learning of waste types and makes responsible and aware citizens.

# Motivation behind project
Our project is in line with the Swachh Bharat Movement started by our Hon'ble Prime Minister. We aim to educate the children of the country about the types of waste and how to handle them, thus helping make our country a better place to live in. This app would be equally beneficial for the uneducated adult citizens.
The current state of affairs is a far cry from the golden age of Indian history, which was an epitome of cleanliness. With this project, we hope to do our part in achieving those standards of cleanliness in our country once again.

# Financial and Market viability
Our app will be a one of a kind experience, as there are not a lot ready-to-use waste classifiers so easily available to the young ones and this friendly to use. The app size is minimal and the leaderboard allows entry of upto 20, 000 users. No internet connection is required to identify the type of waste, but to update the leaderboard, internet connection is required. To make cash prizes viable, we can introduce Google Ads into our app.
